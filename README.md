# PureRank

PureRank is a Swift library for skill-based player ranking and matchmaking, inspired by TrueSkill. It provides a way to track player performance over time and generate fair matchups in games or competitions.

PureRank is based on the TrueSkill™ ranking system developed by Microsoft Research, created by R. Herbrich, T. Minka, and T. Graepel.
